The project I'm submitting to this repository addresses the need for the "Corner Grocer" to understand the frequency of various items purchased by customers.
By tracking and analyzing this data, the store can make informed decisions on inventory management and product placement to enhance customer experience
and sales efficiency.

I believe something I did particularly well was the implementation of the "ItemTracker" class and it's methods. The class encapsulates the core functionality needed to track item frequencies efficiently using a
"map<string, int>". Methods such as 'LoadData','GetItemFrequency','PrintAllFrequencies',and 'PrintHistogram' are well structured and achieve their respective goals effectively.

I believe i could enhance the code by incorporating more robust error handling and data validation. For example, checking for potential issues like empty files or invalid data formats in the input file could prevent 
runtime errors. Additionally, using a more sophisticated data structure or algorithim for large datasets might improve performance.

The most challening part was implementing the histogram display. Ensuring the output was visually clear and correctly represented the data required me to be careful of formatting. 
I overcame this by iterating on the output format and using setw and left for alignment.

Skills such as file I/O operations, data structure manipulation (using maps), and implementing user interfaces via console menus are highly transferable. These foundational skills are applicable in numerous other programming tasks and projects.

The program is maintable and readable due to clear class design, method separation, and concise comments explaining key sections of the code. The use of a class to encapsulate item tracking logic makes the code modular and easier to adapt to future requirements,
such as additional functionalities or different data formats.
